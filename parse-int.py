# Converts a string to an integer

# What this method actually does is to check whether the input
# String is numeric or not, by the use of the regex \\d+,
# not proceeding in that case, and returning âˆ’1.
#
# In case it passes the check, it goes ahead, creates a char array
# out of the String, and for each character c, multiplies (c - 48)
# with 10 raised to the power its index to manage the place value system
